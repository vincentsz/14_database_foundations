-- n this set of exercises, we will work with a billing database for a company that provides web hosting services to its customers. 
-- The database will contain information about its customers and the services each customer uses. Each customer can have any number of services, 
-- and every service can have any number of customers. 
-- Thus, there will be a many-to-many (M:M) relationship between the customers and the services. 
-- Some customers don't presently have any services, and not every service must be in use by any customers.

-- -- Initially, we need to create a billing database with a customers table and a services table. 
-- The customers table should include the following columns:

-- --     id is a unique numeric customer id that auto-increments and serves as a primary key for this table.
-- --     name is the customer's name. This value must be present in every record and may contain names of any length.
--     payment_token is a required unique 8-character string that consists of solely uppercase alphabetic letters.
--  It identifies each customer's payment information with the payment processor the company uses.

-- -- The services table should include the following columns:

-- --     id is a unique numeric service id that auto-increments and serves as a primary key for this table.
-- --     description is the service description. This value must be present and may contain any text.
-- --     price is the annual service price. It must be present, must be greater than or equal to 0.00. The data type is numeric(10, 2).

-- -- Once you've created these tables, here is some data that you can enter into them (feel free to enter some data of your own as well):

-- -- Data for the customers table

-- id | name          | payment_token
-- --------------------------------
-- 1  | Pat Johnson   | XHGOAHEQ
-- 2  | Nancy Monreal | JKWQPJKL
-- 3  | Lynn Blake    | KLZXWEEE
-- 4  | Chen Ke-Hua   | KWETYCVX
-- 5  | Scott Lakso   | UUEAPQPS
-- 6  | Jim Pornot    | XKJEYAZA

-- -- Data for the services table

-- id | description         | price
-- ---------------------------------
-- 1  | Unix Hosting        | 5.95
-- 2  | DNS                 | 4.95
-- 3  | Whois Registration  | 1.95
-- 4  | High Bandwidth      | 15.00
-- 5  | Business Support    | 250.00
-- 6  | Dedicated Hosting   | 50.00
-- 7  | Bulk Email          | 250.00
-- 8  | One-to-one Training | 999.00

-- Once you have entered the data into your tables, create a join table that associates customers with services and vice versa. 
-- The join table should have columns for both the services id and the customers id, as well as a primary key named id that auto-increments.

-- The customer id in this table should have the property that deleting the corresponding customer record from the customers table 
-- will automatically delete all rows from the join table that have that customer_id. Do not apply this same property to the service id.

-- Each combination of customer and service in the table should be unique. 
-- In other words, a customer shouldn't be listed as using a particular service more than once.

-- -- Enter some data in the join table that shows which services each customer uses as follows:

-- --     Pat Johnson uses Unix Hosting, DNS, and Whois Registration
-- --     Nancy Monreal doesn't have any active services
--     Lynn Blake uses Unix Hosting, DNS, Whois Registration, High Bandwidth, and Business Support
--     Chen Ke-Hua uses Unix Hosting and High Bandwidth
--     Scott Lakso uses Unix Hosting, DNS, and Dedicated Hosting
--     Jim Pornot uses Unix Hosting, Dedicated Hosting, and Bulk Email
