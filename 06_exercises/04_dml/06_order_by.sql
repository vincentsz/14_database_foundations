-- In the previous exercise, we had to use a GROUP BY clause to obtain the expected output. In that exercise, we used an SQL query like:

SELECT devices.name AS name, COUNT(parts.device_id)
FROM devices
JOIN parts ON devices.id = parts.device_id
GROUP BY devices.name
ORDER BY devices.name DESC;

-- Now, we want to work with the same query, but we want to guarantee that the devices and the count of their parts are listed in descending alphabetical order. 
-- Alter the SQL query above so that we get a result table that looks like the following.

-- name          | count
-- --------------+-------
-- Gyroscope     |     5
-- Accelerometer |     3
-- (2 rows)
