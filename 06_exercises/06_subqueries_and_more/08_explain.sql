-- or this exercise, let's explore the EXPLAIN PostgreSQL statement. It's a very useful SQL statement that lets us analyze the efficiency of our SQL statements. 
-- More specifically, use EXPLAIN to check the efficiency of the query statement we used in the exercise on EXISTS:

-- SELECT name FROM bidders
-- WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bids WHERE bids.bidder_id = bidders.id);

-- First use just EXPLAIN, then include the ANALYZE option as well. For your answer, list any SQL statements you used, 
-- along with the output you get back, and your thoughts on what is happening in both case

EXPLAIN SELECT name FROM bidders
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bids WHERE bids.bidder_id = bidders.id);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT name FROM bidders
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bids WHERE bids.bidder_id = bidders.id);
