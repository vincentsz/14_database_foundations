-- When we initially created our birds table, we forgot to take into account a key factor: 
-- preventing certain values from being entered into the database. 
-- For instance, we would never find a bird that is negative n years old. 
-- We could have included a constraint to ensure that bad data isn't entered for a database record, but we forgot to do so.

-- For this exercise, write some code that ensures that only birds with a positive age may be added to the database. 
-- Then write and execute an SQL statement to check that this new constraint works correctly.

ALTER TABLE birds
  ADD CONSTRAINT check_age
  CHECK (age > 0);

INSERT INTO birds (name, age, species)
VALUES ('Theo', -3, 'immortal');
