-- It seems there was a mistake when we were inserting data in the birds table. All the crows are actually ravens. 
-- Update the birds table so that the rows with a species of 'Crow' now read 'Raven'

UPDATE birds
SET species = 'Raven'
  WHERE species = 'Crow';


UPDATE birds
SET species = 'Hawk'
WHERE name = 'Jamie';
