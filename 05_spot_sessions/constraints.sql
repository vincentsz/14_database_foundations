-- Table constraints are constraints that are applied to the entire table, while column constraints are constraints that are applied to a specific column in the table.

-- Examples of table constraints include:

-- Primary Key: A primary key constraint is used to enforce uniqueness of values in a column or set of columns that uniquely identify each row in the table.
-- Unique Constraint: A unique constraint is used to ensure that no two rows in the table have the same value in a specified column or set of columns.
-- Check Constraint: A check constraint is used to enforce a specific condition or range of values for a column.
-- Examples of column constraints include:

-- NOT NULL Constraint: A NOT NULL constraint is used to ensure that a specific column does not contain any NULL values.
-- DEFAULT Constraint: A DEFAULT constraint is used to specify a default value for a column if no value is specified during an insert operation.
-- CHECK Constraint: A CHECK constraint can also be applied to a specific column to enforce a specific condition or range of values for that column.
